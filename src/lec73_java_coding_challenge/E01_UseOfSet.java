	// This below 2 line is a very very important interview question. question: difference between Set and List
	// Set doesn't allow duplicate data
	// Set doesn't follow indexing
	// Set is a member of Collection framework, where deal with multiple data type
	// Set <String> abc = new HashSet<String>();
	// type of variable use here, line 11 - is String
	// abc is the name of object

	// Interface can't instantiate themselves
