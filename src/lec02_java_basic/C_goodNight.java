// How to solve indentation issue?
// 1) to solve a single line: control/command+i

// limitation: it can't remove white space

// 2) how to solve multiple lines? (not practiced)
// control/command+a
// control/command+i
// limitation: it can't remove white space

// always use below command, above info is for the info that they cannot remove white space
// what is the final solution for indentation issue/problem?
// shift+control/command+f -- advantage: it can also remove white space 
// always at the end of code, follow shift+control/command+f  and then save all (shift+control/command+s)

// how to save a class -- control/command+s
// how to save all the classes opened -- shift + control/command+s

// Run by 4 way -- 1) Green play button, 2) right click on code -- run as -- java application,
